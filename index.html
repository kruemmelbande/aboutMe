			<h1>
				Hello there, my name is Kruemmelbande, but you can call me Kai. <br>
				I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for programming, <br>
				primarily using Python but also dabbling in other languages like C.<br>
				As someone on the autism spectrum, I can be a little shy sometimes,<br>
				but I'm always eager to connect with others and share my interests.<br>

				When I'm not programming, I like to spend my time playing games like Beat Saber<br>
				and Dead by Daylight. In my free time, I like to relax in Discord and chat with friends, <br>
				and I'm currently trying to improve my drawing skills.<br>
				
				I'm always open to meeting new people and trying out new things,<br>
				so don't hesitate to say hello if you see me around. <br>
				While I enjoy VRChat, it's not the only thing I do, <br>
				so feel free to reach out if you want to play games or chat about programming,<br>
				gaming, or anything else that interests you.</h1>
